Can you give a rough estimate of how long Bubble Sort and Merge Sort
will take for 50,000 elements? What factors would go into whether your
 estimate would be high or low? Picking different algorithms to solve a
 problem can lead to significant differences in application performance at scale.

- Bubble sort depends on the initial positions of elements within the set. If the set is nearly sorted in the beginning, with minimal
  mixups, then bubble_sort should work fairly fast. Worst case scenario is when the set is sorted in reverse, causing the algorithm to
  run at O(n^2)

 Approximately how long do you estimate it will take to run this for 100,000 elements?
 - Given that 10x the elements causes the bubble sort to take 100% (8.00 -> 991.810) more time, and
 minor experimentation with the sorting code, the runtime might take 4x longer than the 50,000 test case
